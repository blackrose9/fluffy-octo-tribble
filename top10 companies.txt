Founded in the 1890's
We work to create a better future every day, with brands and services that help make sustainable living commonplace.

Our USLP has three big goals:
Help more than a billion people to improve their health and wellbeing. 
Halve the environmental footprint of our products. 
Source 100% of our agricultural raw materials sustainably and enhance the livelihoods of people across our value chain.
